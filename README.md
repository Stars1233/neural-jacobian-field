> 🔥 **Follow-up work:** [**VERA — Turning Video Models into Generalist Robot Policies**](https://github.com/sizhe-li/VERA) turns a frozen video generative model into a robot policy: the video model dreams the future, and a Jacobian inverse dynamics model — built on the same idea as Jacobian fields — translates the dream into actions, from a real Franka arm to a 16-DoF Allegro hand.

## 🚀 Quickstart

We provide the software implementations of:
- 🧠 3D Jacobian Field: `project/neural_jacobian_field`  
- ✋ 2D Jacobian Field: `project/jacobian`  
- 🧪 Custom simulator: [`mujoco-phys-sim`](https://github.com/sizhe-li/mujoco-phys-sim.git)

## 📦 Installation

### ✅ Clone & Initialize Submodules (Required)

This repository depends on a custom simulator included as a Git submodule.  
After cloning, **you must initialize it with:**

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### 1. Create Conda Environment

```bash
conda create --name neural-jacobian-field python=3.10.8
conda activate neural-jacobian-field
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```
bash install.sh
```

This script:
- Installs PyTorch 
- Pins NumPy for binary compatibility
- Installs Nerfstudio + TinyCudaNN
- jBuilds and installs the MuJoCo simulator
- Installs all Jacobian Field packages in editable mode

#### 3. Sanity Check (Recommended)

After installation:
```
python3 -c "import torch, jacobian, neural_jacobian_field, raft_wrapper; print('✅ Installation OK')"
```

## ▶️ Running the Code
### 📥 Download Pretrained Checkpoints

Download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fq0nngkeRWhCJ_CAyzQopYda20Zu-Zu8?usp=drive_link) and place them under:

```
notebooks/inference_demo_data/real_world_pretrained_ckpts
notebooks/tutorial/tutorial_pretrained_ckpts
```

Disclaimer on 2D toy examples: since mujoco has updated its renderer recently. The old checkpoint might not generalize to the new rendering style. It is best to retrain the model yourself after generating the 2D datasets!

## 🏋️‍♀️ Training

### A. Train Perception Module (PixelNeRF)

```
python3 -m neural_jacobian_field.train dataset=dataset_allegro model=model_allegro dataset.mode=perception
```
### B. Train Jacobian Fields

Replace the `checkpoint` flag with what you have on wandb :) and start training

```
python3 -m neural_jacobian_field.train dataset=dataset_allegro model=model_allegro dataset.mode=action checkpoint.load=wandb://entity/project/usoftylr:v5
```

## 🎥 Camera Conventions
- Extrinsics: OpenCV-style camera-to-world matrices
(+Z = look vector, +X = right, –Y = up)
- Intrinsics: Normalized (row 1 ÷ width, row 2 ÷ height)

## FAQ

### Q: Training seems extremely slow (e.g., 1300 hours estimated on an NVIDIA A40). Is this normal?
Yes, everything is fine! The number of training steps in the default config (**50 million**) is somewhat arbitrary. In practice, you can stop once you see good 3D reconstruction results during stage 1 (PixelNeRF), and then move on to fitting Jacobian fields. You usually don’t need to run the full 50M steps.

---

### Q: What hardware did you use for training?
We tested training on:
- **4 × A8000s**
- **4 × A100s**

For testing on a local robot-ready PC after training, we used a **single RTX 4090**.

---

### Q: Can I train with multiple GPUs?
Yes. The training script supports multi-GPU setups. By default, the script will use all available GPUs. You can set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to select specific GPUs. We recommend multi-GPU for large-scale training, especially with the full dataset.

---

### Q: My run goes out-of-memory (OOM) even with small `rays_per_batch`. Why?
This usually happens if `action_supervision_type` is set to `tracks`.

- In **track supervision**, `rays_per_batch` is **ignored**.  
- Instead, the number of rays is determined by: `num_positive_samples` + `num_negative_samples`. If both values are `null` (default), the dataloader uses **all tracks** (often ~10,000 rays), which easily causes OOM.

---

### Q: What supervision type should I use for the Allegro hand?
For the Allegro hand dataset, we by default use **optical flow supervision** (via RAFT), *not* track supervision. Both types of supervision have been tested and work well.
